# BlueberryV
The goal of this project is to design a 5-stage pipelined processor that supports a subset of the RISC-V RV32I ISA using Verilog. After taking ECE 460N (Computer Architecture) and ECE 460M (Digital System Design with Hardware Description Language), I wanted to try applying my knowledge by designing a basic RISC-V processor. I’ve never done a computer architecture related project before, nor have I ever done a project of this scale, so I’m hoping this will be a good learning experience.

The documentation is continuously evolving and can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vXfgaKM1o5NJTIKNQolMSV3OCGOPerlEGphdr4SbKKg/edit?tab=t.0).
